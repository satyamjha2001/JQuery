    jQuery is tailor-made to respond to events in an HTML page.

    What are Events?
    All the different visitor's actions that a web page can respond to are called events.

    An event represents the precise moment when something happens.

    Examples:

    moving a mouse over an element
    selecting a radio button
    clicking on an element
    The term "fires/fired" is often used with events. Example: "The keypress event is fired, the moment you press a key".
