    <!-- jQuery supports 3 types of keyboard events and which we are :
    keyup(): Event fired when a key is released on the keyboard.
    keydown(): Event fired when a key is pressed on the keyboard.
    keypress:() Event fired when a key is pressed on the keyboard.
    From above definitions, it looks like that keydown() and keypress() are same thing. -->

    <!-- The order of events related to the keypress event:
    keydown - The key is on its way down
    keypress - The key is pressed down
    keyup - The key is released
    The keypress() method triggers the keypress event, or attaches a function to run when a keypress event occurs.
    The keypress event is similar to the keydown event. The event occurs when a button is pressed down.
    However, the keypress event is not fired for all keys (e.g. ALT, CTRL, SHIFT, ESC). Use the keydown() method to also check these keys. -->
