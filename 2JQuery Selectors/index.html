      When someone goes out of their way to help you out, it's hard not to say
      thanks. Sometimes we need to let them know that what they've done will be
      remembered forever. People don't realize that some of the smallest things
      they do make a huge difference in our life and livelihood. Even it seems
      small, make the thanks big.

      “Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life; dream of it; think of it;
      live on that idea. Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, every part of
      your body be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone.
      This is the way to success, and this is the way great spiritual giants are
      produced.” - Swami Vivekananda
